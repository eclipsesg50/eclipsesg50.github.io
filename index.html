      <h1>HOMEPAGE</h1>
      <p>Hi everyone!</p>
      <p>This is Team Eclipse from engineering academy tryouts. Our Team consists of Vincent, Yanru and Sorenson.
      This site is a platform for us to document what we have learnt during the tryout session, our progress and works of the project
      for this tryout and our reviews and reflection of the tryout. </p>
      <p> Our project is to build automated plane launcher that can launch a paper plane accurately over a long distance.
      We will use arduino to control the launcher. We decided to select acrylic as our fabrication material. A brief overview of our design will be a launcher that uses a pair of motorised wheels to launch our plane which rests on the rails </p>
