      <h1>Eclipse's review</h1>
        <h2>Group's review</h2>
        <h3>What can be improved in our project?</h3>
        <p>We think that we can focus more on the design and aesthetics of the launcher as ours is too plain.</p>
        <h3>What went wrong and what did we do to solve it?</h3>
        <p>At fisrt, our plane could not fly far. We thought it is the launcher's problem but we eventually realised it is the paper plane problem. Thus, we decided to use another design and this time it can fly rather far away.</p>
        <h3>What could have been done better?</h3>
        <p>Besides focusing on  the sructurere of the launcher, we should  focus mor on the paper airplane itself and test a few times before the competition so we can find the angle and design of the paper airplane with which can our distance be further</p>

        <h2>Individual's review</h2>
        <h3>Sorenson's review</h3>
        <p>The thing I enjoyed the most about the tryout is the fabrication, assembly and fine tuning of the launcher. I enjoyed it becuase I like to make things and also it is my first time using a drill and seeing the laser cutter in action.<br>The thing I enjoyed the least about the tryout is the programming the launcher using ardiuno as I find it difficult to make sense of th lines after lines of coding<br>In order to improve future tryout sessions, some basic fabrication and assembly lessons like how to drill through acrylic without breaking the acrylic should be taught. There should also be more hot glue guns, workstations and working equipments to be made available in the workshop for the fabrication and assembly of the luancher V/p>

        <h3>Yanru's review</h3>
        <p>During the three days, I really enjoy learn and apply what I have learnt.With the instructor's guidance,I troubleshot the problem appeared and discovered the amaze of engineeing.However, I feel that the lecture conducted at the beginning of everyday was not that clear and helpful such that lecturer need to spend more time helping students troubleshooting. </p>
