                   <h1>Eclipse's review</h1>
                   <h2>Group's review</h2>
                   <h3>What can be improved in our project?</h3>
                  <p>We think that we can focus more on the design and aesthetics of the launcher as ours is too plain.</p>
                   <h3>What went wrong and what did we do to solve it?</h3>
                  <p>At first, our plane could not fly far. We thought it is the launcher's problem but we eventually realised it is the paper plane problem. Thus, we decided to use another design and this time it can fly relatively far away.</p>
                   <h3>What could have been done better?</h3>
                  <p>Besides focusing on the cructure strthe lauuncher, we should focus more on the paper airplane itself and test a few times before the competition so we can find the angle and design of the paper airplane in which can our distance be further</p>
                  <hr>
                   <h2>Individual's review</h2>
                   <h3>Sorenson's review</h3>
                  <p>The thing I enjoyed the most about the tryout is the fabrication, assembly and fine tuning of the launcher because I like to make things and also
                      <br>The thing Itime using a drill and seeing the laser cutter in action. enjoyed the least about the tryout is the programmine launcher using ardiuno.
                      <br>In Arder t as I find it difficult to make sense of the lines of code improve future tryout sessions, some basic fabI think thatrication and assembly lessons like how to drill through acrylic without breaking the acrylic should be taught.
                      There should also be more hot glue guns, workstations and working equipments to be made available in the workshopator the fabrication and assembly of the luancher</p>
                   <h3>Vincent's review</h3>
                  <p>The first day of the try-out, we were told to build a bridge with ice-cream sticks which is at least 5 cm wide and 30 cm long. That activity allowed me to interact with my new mates and find out their strengths and weaknesses. It didn’t
                      take me long to get that information. We were given 30 minutes to build finish the bridge. While we were brainstorming on what designs we want and I pointed out the possibilities of errors that might cause the structure to be weak. Some
                      of those include, the joints held by hot glue, between 2 ice-cream sticks. The bridge was able to hold a weight of 5 hammers, which is awesome. From that activity I learn some of the skills in using a hot glue, which is to immediately
                      glue after the hot glue is being applied to surface. We were then asked to design the paper is such that the paper can fly. 2 designs for accuracy and 1design for distance. Obviously, many students will make a paper plane, but I wanted
                      to make something different. So, I fold the paper into a business card shaped and started throwing it. I personally have a skill in card throwing so it is easy for me to throw far and accurate. We test out our designs and my design
                      flew far as expected. We were then taught html. It is used for recording the progress when we make the launcher. We were then taught some basics of Arduino programming and how to operate different kinds of motor. Personally, I know
                      how to use basic AutoCAD and how to write basic code for Arduino. The process of building the launcher was long so I won’t go into the details, but it was worth it when we tested our launcher. The launcher managed to launch the paper
                      plane for around 4 meters. It is a great achievement but at the same time It can also be improved At the end of the 3-days try-outs, I feel that Engineering Academy is fun, but I am also aware that the actual program isn’t as simple
                      as what the instructors guide and show us. I am looking forward to joining the Engineering Academy. I always believed a saying where the only limit to human potential is imagination.</p>
                   <h3>Yanru's review</h3>
                  <p>During the three days, I really enjoy learn and apply what I have leart.With the help of the instructor,I have learnt how to troubleshoot the problem and discovered the amaze of engineeing.However ,I feel that the lecture conducted at the beginning
                      of everyday was not that clear and helpful such that lecturer need to spend more time helping students troubleshooting.</article>
